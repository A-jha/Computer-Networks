# Layering in Computer Networks

Layering means decomposing the problems into more managable components(Layers).

### Advantages:

- It provides modular design
- Easy to troubleshoot

## Role of protocol in Layering

- Protocol is a set of rules that governs data communication.
- The protocol in each layer governs the activity of the data communication.

## Layered Architectures

1. The OSI Reference Model
2. The TCP/IP Model

## 1. The OSI Model

- OSI stands for **Open System Interconnection**
- It is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture that is **flexible** , **robust**(â€‹strong and determined) and **iteroperable**(able to exchange and make use of information, like can be used on both windows and linux os).

- Developed by the international Standards for Organizations (**ISO**).
- **The OSI model is not a protocol**.
- It is only guideline and hence it is refered as OSI reference model.

### Purpose of OSI Model

- The pupose of OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different system without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software.

- The OSI Model is never fully implemented.

## 2. The TCP/IP Model

- TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
- The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI Model.

- Therefore the layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match the osi model.
- **TCP/IP is a hirachical protocol** made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific functionality.
