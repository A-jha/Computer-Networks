# Waht is a Computer Network ?

A computer network is a set of nodes connected by communication links.

## What is Node ?

A node can be computer, printer, or any other device capapable of sending and receiving data generated by other nodes in the network.

Examples:

- computer
- server
- printer
- Security camera
- Switches
- bridge
- routers
- etc . .

## What is communication link ?

A communication link can be wired or wirless link. Link carries the information.

A computer network is mainly used for resource sharing.

# Basic Charecteristics of computer Network

- Fault tolerance
- Scalability
- Quality of Service
- Security

## Fault tolerance

The ability to

- Continue working despite failure
- Ensuring no loss of service

## Scalability

The ability to

- Grow based on needs
- Have good performance after growth

## Quality of service

The ability to

- Set priorities (realtime call will get more priorities than an email sent by some user)
- Manage data trafic to reduce data loss, delay etc

# Security

The ability to prevent

- Unauthorized access
- Misuse
- Forgery

The abiltiy to provide

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

# Network protocol and communication

## Data Communication

Data communications are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link (transmission medium) such as cable.

## Data Flow

Data flow means data is going to flow from one node to another node.

Three different flows are

- Simplex
- Half Duplex
- Full Duplex

### Simplex Dataflow

- Communication is always unidirectional
- One device can transmit and other will receive

  Examples:

  - Keyboard
  - Traditional monitors

### Half Duplex Dataflow

- Communication is in both direction but not at the same time.
- if one device is sending, the other can only receive and viceversa.

  Examples:

  - Walkie-Talkies

### Full Duplex Dataflow or Duplex

- Communication is both direction simultaniously.
- Davice can send and receive data at same time.
  Example:
  - Telephone Lines

## Protocols

All communication schemes will have the following things in common:

- Source or sender
- Destination or receiver
- Channel or media

Rules of protocol govern all methods of communication.

- Protocol = Rule
- It is a set of rules that govern data communication
- Protocol determines:
  - What is communicated?
  - How it is communicated?
  - When it is communicated?

### Need of Protocol in Network Communication

Protocols used in network communication also define :

- Message encoding
- Message formatting and encapsulation
- Message Timing
- Message Size
- Message Delivery option

These are called elements of protocol.

### 1. Message Encoding

![encoing](../assets/encoding.svg)

### 2. Meesage Formatting and Encapsulation

A format on which Sender and Receiver both are aggred.

Encapsulate the information to identify the sender and receiver intigrity.

### 3. Message Size

Human break long message into smaller parts or sentences.

Long message must be broken into smaller part to travel across network.

### 4. Meesage Timing

Message timing deals with **flow control** and **response timeout**.

- flow control : if sender is very fast and receiver is slow than network should mannage the flow of messages .(if flow control is not available then chances of data loss is very high)
- response timeout - an approximate time to get response from sender message or reciever massage.

### 5. Message Delivery Option

- Unicast : One sender and One receiver
- MultiCast : one sender to set of receiver
- Broadcast : one sender to all receiver

## Peer to Peer Network

- No cetralized administration
- All peers are equal
- Simple sharing application
- Not Scalable

## Cleint Server Nework

- Centralized administration
- Request-response model
- Scalable
- Server may be overloaded

# Various Components of Computer network

1. Nodes
2. Media
3. Services

## 1. Nodes

A nodes can send or receive data.

- End Nodes (end devices)
- Intermediary nodes.

### End Nodes

Staring or end point of the communications.

- Computer
- Network printers
- Volp Phones
- Telepresence Endpoint(for video conferencing)

### Intermidiary Node

Node that just forwards the data from one node to another node.

- Switches
- Wireless access points
- Routers
- Security Devices (firewall)
- Bridges
- Hubs
- Repeaters
- Cell Tower

## 2. Media

Medial is also K/A Link that carries data.
This link can be :

- Wired Medium (Guided Medium) : Cable is present to guide the data flow hence guided medium.

  - Ethernet Straight through cable(connects different types of nodes)
  - Ethernet Crossover cable (connects similar type of nodes)
  - Fiber Optic Cable
  - Coaxial Cable
  - USB Cable

- Wireless Medium (Unguided Medium) : absence of cable hence unguided medium.
  - Infrared (short range communication - TV remote)
  - Radio (Bluetooth, wifi)
  - Microwaves ( Cellular systems)
  - Satalite (Long range communication - GPS)

## 3. Services

- e-mail

- It is the **on-demand availability** of computer syatem resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

# Network Topology

Arrangement of nodes in computer network.

**Topology = Layout**

## Physical and Logical Topology

- Physical Topology - Placement of various nodes.
- Logical topology - Deals with the data flow in the network.

## Various types of Topology

- Bus
- Ring
- Star
- Mesh
- Hybrid

## 1. Bus Topology

All data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this **common transmission medium** and is able to receive by all nodes in the network simultaneously.

A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travel from a source machine in **both directions** to all machines connected to the bus until it finds the intended recipient.

![bus](../assets/bus.svg)

| Advantages                          | Disadvantages                       |

| Node failure does not efeect others | No security                         |

## 2. Ring Topology

- A ring topology is a bus topology in a closed loop.
- Peer-To-Peer LAN topology.
- Two connections one to ech nearest neighbours.
- Unidirectional
- Sending and receiving data takes palce with the help of **Tokens**.

| No. of Nodes(N) | No. of Cables | No.of Port/Device | Total No of Ports |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |

| Can cause bottleneck due to weak links | ↑ in load - ↓ in performance                                      |
| All nodes with equal access            | No Security                                                       |

## 3. Star Topology

- Every node is connected to a central node called a hub or switch.
- Centralized management.
- All trafic must pass through hub and switch.

| No. of Nodes(N) | No. of Cables | No.of Port/Device | Total No of Ports |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| N               | N             | 1                 | 2 x N             |

- all devices are connected to switch/hub which require N port too to connect them.
  ![star](../assets/star.svg)

| Advantages                   | Disadvantages                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

# Basics Of IP Address

IP Stands for internet Protocol.

Every node in the computer network is identified with the help of IP address.

## IPV4 Address

- IP address is a logic address .
- IP address can change based on the location of devices.
- IP address is Assigned manually or Dynamically.
- Represented in decimal and it has 4 octets(X.X.X.X)
- IP address can be in range of 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255(32bits)

![ipaddress](../assets/ipaddr.svg)

## Command to check IP address

```bash
ipconfig
#or
ip addr
```

# Basics of MAC Address

- MAC Stands for Media Access Control.
- Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC Address.
- IP Address = Location of the Person
- MAC Address = Name of the Person
- MAC address are physical address or Hardware address
- MAC Address are unique
- MAC address never changes
- Assigned by the manufacturer.
- Represented in Hexadecimal.
- Example : 70-20-84-ED-FC(48-bits)
- Separator: hyphen(-), period(.). and colon(:).

## Difference between IP Address and MAC Address

| IP Address                              | MAC Address                             |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Needed for communication                | Needed for communication                |
| 32 bits                                 | 48 bits                                 |
| Represented in decimal                  | Represented in Hexa decimal             |
| Routers need IP address to forward data | Switch need MAC address to forward data |
| Example: 10.10.23.56                    | Example: 70-20-84-OO-ED-FC              |
