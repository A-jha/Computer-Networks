# Various Components of Computer network

1. Nodes
2. Media
3. Services

## 1. Nodes

A nodes can send or receive data.

- End Nodes (end devices)
- Intermediary nodes.

### End Nodes

Staring or end point of the communications.

- Computer
- Network printers
- Volp Phones
- Telepresence Endpoint(for video conferencing)
- Security camera

Mobile handheld devices (smart phones, tablets, PDAs, wireless debit/credit card reader, barcode scanner)

### Intermidiary Node

Node that just forwards the data from one node to another node.

- Switches
- Wireless access points
- Routers
- Security Devices (firewall)
- Bridges
- Hubs
- Repeaters
- Cell Tower

## 2. Media

Medial is also K/A Link that carries data.
This link can be :

- Wired Medium (Guided Medium) : Cable is present to guide the data flow hence guided medium.

  - Ethernet Straight through cable(connects different types of nodes)
  - Ethernet Crossover cable (connects similar type of nodes)
  - Fiber Optic Cable
  - Coaxial Cable
  - USB Cable

- Wireless Medium (Unguided Medium) : absence of cable hence unguided medium.
  - Infrared (short range communication - TV remote)
  - Radio (Bluetooth, wifi)
  - Microwaves ( Cellular systems)
  - Satalite (Long range communication - GPS)

## 3. Services

- e-mail
- Storage Service
- File Sharing
- Instant messaging
- Online game
- Voice over IP
- Video Telephony
- Wold Wide Web
